                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            Facebook is a site where its users can easily make their account and after making it they can log into it. It was launched in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg when he was in his university. By now, it has reached to each an everyone corner of th e world. Most of the people in the world are using it or they have made an account. Approximately more than 5B PLUS people have downloaded it. 
                            <br>
                            It is basically a social site, where a person can contact with another person from one place to another.  Face book is the easiest way to communicate with people all around the globe. It also helps us to send messages and do calling with our loved ones whenever we want. It enables its user to share their pictures or upload their pictures online with the people they have added. A person has to make an account with a valid email address so that they can log in to their face book ids whenever they want. People from the age 13 can easily use it. It has an ability to connect people all around the globe within seconds, it also allows people to share their pictures and content on the timeline, on which the people those they added on their friend list can easily react with the help of these emoji or reacts. They can also share their expressions and feelings with the help of these. 
                            <center>

                            </center>
                            Facebook is basically powered by algorithm. Facebook's algorithm is capable of learning each user's preferences and interests. What they want, what do they need etc. Face book also runs business advertisements with the help of these opportunities many of the small business have started to begin and the business or employment ratio has also been increased. They also use Artificial Intelligence to provide the most comfortable platform to their customers. The algorithm shows images, status updates, and videos posted by friends and businesses that the user might be interested in. 
                            <br>
                            Facebook also runs business advertisements, which are mixed in with organic content shared by your mates on the face book newsfeed. In the previous times, the face book used the chronological timeline, in which the posts used to appear on the feed with the help of the timeline.  We can now see the content that Facebook's algorithm believes we will enjoy the most, because it collects up the data and enables us to watch according to our interests. Facebook has a system known as Gatekeeper that allows them to run different code for different groups of users (it basically introduces different conditions in the code base). 
                            <br>
                            FACEBOOK uses secure browsing to protect our information. Based on our Face book activities, whether it is posting a video or a message, it is encrypted, which means it is converted into code and cannot be accessed without your permission. Facebook does not share anyone’s private information with any of its friends unless we don’t want it too. Face book can detect about the viruses we have, and let us know about it. Other than this, it has helped us to make the privacy setting according to ourselves. E.g.: posting a video or a post publically or only with friends.  But, there are privacy concerns too. If the account is being hacked by someone, they can easily take all of data, pictures and messages and the cases are serious and most of it is related to the privacy concerns which results in life threats too. Other than this, if you have shared a picture on your timeline, it can be easily shared by the other people to their friends or with anyone too, which can also trigger someone privacy concerns.  Once the video id viral, there is no way back.

                        <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;" class="text-center mb-5">INSTAGRAM</h3>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            It is an app which was generated by Kevin Systrom is 2010. It is basically a video sharing and picture sharing platform, where people can share their content and videos, or they can make the reels. They can share the messages too or they can easily do a video and an audio call to their friends and family as well. It can help people to grow, to let their friends know whatever they are doing in their lives with just a click, they can also click pictures and add up to the stories for 24-hours on which people can also react with hearts. Other than this, instagram does sponsoring or they do the advertisements too for a particular brand. This is done with help of the algorithm too.  All parts of the instagram algorithm works differently. A user will get the notifications or pictures first on their feed from their nearest and closest friend whom they follow.  The algorithm works differently while searching, watching reels, uploading a picture, scrolling etc. Algorithm does not allow fake news and fake accounts to be appeared on the timeline. 
                            <br>
                            The algorithm takes into account what other posts users have liked in order to match them with relevant content.The post's popularity, and how quickly it receives likes, shares, comments, and saves, is the sticking point here. The posting account's interaction history with the user. The majority of posts on Explore will come from accounts that users have never heard of. However, if a user has previously interacted with an account, the likelihood of an algorithm match increases. Their likes, shares, and comments on other Explore posts aid in the discovery of new content. 
                            <br>
                            A user can make their accounts public or private. They have the authority that who will see their pictures and who will not. Strict restrictions are imposed by the instagram. A person can report an account if it’s suspicious. But other than this, there are privacy concern too. If your phone or tablet location is on it can easily access the location of you to the other people. Other than this, it can allow people to see which type of friends, favorite celebrities we have with the help of the following.  A person can easily access to the people following and get to know whom they have followed or liked.  Our photos which we are uploading can be used by anyone even our followers, we will not even get a notice about it. If our account is not private, everyone is allowed to see the stories, videos and reels, which can be a lot risky. 
                            <br>
                            The new DM function is making quite a stir. Some people don't want their followers to know when they're using the app. You can disable this function, but it isn't the only means for other users to know what you're up to. When you post a remark on a photo, a friend who is also viewing it may notice your comment towards the bottom, even if the photo is of a celebrity with hundreds of responses. If you’re typing in the chat or in the chat it will pop up and let the other person know. It has a lot of privacy concerns.
                        </p>

They can even add their own sounds and lip-sync to the videos of other users.  What appears in your "For You" feed is determined by the TikTok algorithm. The TikTok formula predicts that the videos a user will see in their "For You" feed will change over time based on their viewing preferences and habits.

                            <br>
                            TikTok, like many other social networking services, collects a lot of information on its members. This includes every TikTok video you view and how long you watch it for. Because texts are not secured, the whole contents of every message you send using the program. But other than this, if your video is not private your privacy can be easily triggered. People can re-share your videos or they can easily share it to the other friends whom you don’t know without alerting you. 
                            <br>
                            It may have allowed attackers to access and edit TikTok accounts and sensitive information, such as publishing private movies, sending messages, and uploading videos on behalf of users.

                        <p style="text-align: justify;" >
                            Twitter is an online news and social networking site March 21 2006 where users exchange short messages known as tweets. It can put you in touch with someone in Thailand as quickly as it can put you in touch with your next-door neighbor. You can choose to follow industry professionals, news sites, celebrities, comedians, or friends in your feed.
                            <br>
                            Twitter has both infinite meaning and limitless potential. It can put you in touch with someone in Thailand as quickly as it can put you in touch with your next-door neighbour. You can choose to follow industry professionals, news sites, celebrities, comedians, or friends in your feed. Tweeting is the activity of sending brief messages to anybody who follows you on Twitter with the hope that someone in your audience will find your remarks useful and engaging. Micro blogging is another term for Twitter and tweeting. It has complete control over how information is displayed on the platform. This includes everything from suggested accounts to trending tweets. Twitter's algorithms, like most social media algorithms, are entirely focused on personalization. It also helps to make a trend change and make the people aware about the trending issues. The algorithm takes into account a number of factors, including the people you follow, your retweets and liked tweets, the popularity of the tweets, geography, timeframes, and tweet engagement. Twitter employs an algorithm to recommend Topics based on what it believes someone is interested in. Twitter is a safe website since it requires all users to have password-protected accounts.
                            <br>
                            Your account should be safe as long as you protect your password and alter your privacy settings just like facebook, insta etc. it also has some of the hackers threats, not only this, your tweets you are making can be easily retweet and it can easily effect your health, no matter if it is positive or negative. Twitter allows users to communicate with people from all over the world, but it has also become a hazardous site full of harassment and abuse. People have been targeted by organised harassment operations, which can range from threats and spamming to account hacking and worse. DMs could only be sent between two persons that followed each other at first. However, in 2015, Twitter permitted users to open their direct messages to anybody, which may be beneficial for some but harmful for others.

                        <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;" class="text-center mb-5">WECHAT</h3>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            WeChat, which was created in 2011 and is owned by the Chinese internet behemoth Tencent, has expanded from a messaging app to a one-of-a-kind social media mix. Because Facebook is illegal in China, WeChat has emerged as the de facto standard for business and communication. WeChat has basic features including phone chatting, photo messaging, and video calling. You may also share your present position with friends, play mini-games with them, and publish to a feature called "moments," which is similar to Story. It also has a feature called WeChat Out, which allows you to make low-cost international calls. This version includes a localization tool for converting messages and content between 20 different languages. A unique barcode known as a QR code identifies each WeChat user. One individual can scan another user's QR code to add them to WeChat. You may also add a person and search for people in your area by entering a phone number or ID. WeChat is a common method of communication among Chinese people. It also functions as a payment app.
                            <br>
                            The popular Chinese chat software is far from safe in terms of privacy and data collection. Wechat security, like that of many other social programmes, lacks end-to-end encryption. This means that the information sent between the two end-users via the platform is not private. Wechat, on the other hand, employs transport encryption. This means that all data sent between the user and Wechat's server is encrypted.
                            <br>
                            Furthermore, despite the fact that Wechat is controlled by a private corporation, Tencent is subject to Chinese government regulation. In China, the government frequently condemns content that violates its policies. As a result, Chinese users' behaviour can be tracked, controlled, or even used to lower their social credit score.  It allows its users to do payment, which means that they have to send money and the corporation will have all the record of your transactions. One of the most serious issues with WeChat is censorship. It, like all services in China, is constantly monitored by the government. Pictures, comments, and blog articles are heavily censored, with unfavorable viewpoints immediately removed from the platform.

                            It has given its customers an ease to participate in a communication or to communicate with each other with the help of the given features:
                            <li>Voice and video calls</li>
                            <li>Voice messages</li>
                            <li>Secure messages</li>

                            <li>Document sharing</li>

                            WhatsApp displays status updates from all contacts in reverse chronological order, with the most recent status update displayed first. Not only this, the whatsapp alogrithm also enables us to send the messages to the chats which we have recently chat without searching their names in the search box.

                            As talking about the privacy concerns, my consideration is that whatsapp is the most secured app for all of its users to use. It has many facilities which the other ones may lack. It also allows you to manage your privacy concerns and also you can enjoy posting your pictures and videos on statuses, feel free to talk with anyone and anywhere.
                            <br>
                            On the other hand, you are safe and secure to upload your photos, you can change the status privacy in the status option and you can choose any one of them. You can allow the people by yourself or restrict people who can see the pictures or video and who cannot.  Whatsapp chats are fully encrypted. There is not a third party who view or receive data of our calls and messages. So, it is a lot time safer to do messages and calls through whatsapp. Your piracy is kept as a top priority. all of the data you have can be backed up. So there is no chance that if you an important data in your whatsapp it can be lost. Other than this, there are many cases in which people can easily hack the whatsapp accounts through link, mails etc. but there is a solution for it. Whatsapp has enabled a two set verification for its users. They can easily enable it and set a 4 digit pin code (which they can easily remember). This verification can be done every day or every week or it can be done in a month too. It totally depends on what you choose. It helps your account to be save from the hackers and allows your data to keep save. You can also report a wrong number and you can also report the messages too.
